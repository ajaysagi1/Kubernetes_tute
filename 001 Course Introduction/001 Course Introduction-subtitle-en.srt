00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,300
Welcome to the Kubernetes course.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,620
Let me first introduce myself.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,470
My name is Edward Viaene and I'm a consultant and trainer in Cloud and Big Data technologies.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,480
I'm a big advocate of Agile and DevOps techniques in all the projects I work on.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,090
I held various roles from banking to startups.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:28,480
I have a background in Unix/Linux, Networks, Security, Risk and distributed computing. Nowadays.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,070
I specialize in everything that has to do with the cloud and the host. I give.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,540
all online training on Udemy. I do the host, district computing, Cloud and DevOps. I give online training on Udemy. I do DevOps, Distributed Computing, Cloud, Terraform, and Big Data training using online video

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,800
lectures just like this one.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,530
I have more than 7000 enrolled students in more than 100 countries.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,930
This is what the course is going to be about.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,090
I will first start with what is Kubernetes? I will show you how to set up a cluster and how to build

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,700
your first container.

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,590
Then I will teach you the Kubernetes basics.

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,320
It will be about deployments, pods, labels, healthchecks and so on.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,030
Then I have a section on advanced topics.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,050
Those include some more advanced things that you can do with Kubernetes.

18
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,310
And then there's a full section on the administration.

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,560
You need to know how the Kubernetes cluster works and

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,850
You need to be able to administer it. Once you have more people using the cluster,

21
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,950
it can become more challenging.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,460
So what are the course objectives? To be able to understand, to be able to deploy and use Kubernetes

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,930
To get started with containerization and to run those containers on Kubernetes. To use Kubernetes as a single note and on AWS. To be able to run stateless and stateful applications on Kubernetes and

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,120
to be able to administer your Kubernetes cluster.
